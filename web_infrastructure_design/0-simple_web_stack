In this setup:
	•	Domain name: foobar.com with a www subdomain record (A record) pointing to the single server’s IP, 8.8.8.8 (example).


Explanation of Each Component
	1.	Server
		•	A server is a computer (physical or virtual machine) that runs software to serve requests from clients (in this case, users’ web browsers). It listens for incoming connections and responds accordingly.
	2.	Role of the Domain Name (foobar.com / www.foobar.com)
		•	A domain name is a human-readable address used to access a website or service. Instead of typing an IP address, users type www.foobar.com.
		•	The domain name is managed by DNS so that when a user enters www.foobar.com, DNS resolves it to the server’s IP address (8.8.8.8 in this example).
	3.	Type of DNS Record (www.foobar.com)
		•	The www in www.foobar.com is typically an A record in DNS (though it can also be a CNAME in some setups).
		•	Here, it points directly to the IP address of the server, which is 8.8.8.8.
	4.	Role of the Web Server (Nginx)
		•	Nginx (web server) accepts incoming requests (HTTP/HTTPS) from the internet.
		•	It processes those requests and forwards them to the application server, or serves static content directly.
	5.	Role of the Application Server
		•	The application server runs your application’s code (e.g., Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, etc.).
		•	It handles the logic, processes dynamic content, communicates with the database, and returns responses back to Nginx.
	6.	Role of the Database (MySQL)
		•	The MySQL database stores and organizes the site’s data (e.g., user records, blog posts, transactions).
		•	The application server queries or updates the database as needed to fulfill user requests.
	7.	Communication Between Server and User
		•	Communication happens via HTTP/HTTPS protocols over the internet.
		•	The user’s browser sends HTTP/HTTPS requests to www.foobar.com, which the DNS resolves to IP 8.8.8.8.
		•	The single server (running Nginx + application server + MySQL) sends back the appropriate responses.


	Issues / Limitations of This Infrastructure
	1.	Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
		•	Because there is only one server, if it goes down or has issues, the entire website is unavailable.
	2.	Downtime During Maintenance
		•	Any time you need to deploy new code or restart the server, the site experiences downtime. There is no redundancy.
	3.	Limited Scalability
		•	With only one server, once traffic becomes too large, you cannot easily scale to handle higher load. You would need additional servers and load balancing in a more advanced setup.
